# MoCo Crime Explorer
This repository contains code for an R Shiny application that accesses crime data through an API and displays it on a Leaflet map.

The live application can be viewed on <a href='https://brandonkopp.shinyapps.io/MoCo-Crime-Explorer/'>Shinyapps.io</a>.

## UPDATE (2018-06-28)
Montgomery County changed the format of the data passed through the API which broke the application for a bit. I have updated the code to compensate for this. They also changed the coding scheme for crimes.  Finally, I added the "firefly" map option which displays brightly colored points of crime on a black Leaflet map.
